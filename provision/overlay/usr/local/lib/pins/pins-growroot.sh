#!/bin/bash
# Derived from NINA.Polaris packaging/deb/opt/polaris/bin/polaris-growroot.sh (AGPL-3.0).
# Upstream: https://github.com/DanWBR/NINA.Polaris
# Changes: renamed polaris->pins, marker moved to /var/lib/pins/growroot.done,
#          dropped upstream's paragraph about a pre-.deb legacy marker (PINS never
#          had one).
#
# Grow the root partition + filesystem to fill the disk it was flashed onto. A
# shipped image keeps the root partition at its build size, so without this a
# 500 GB SSD carries an 8 GB filesystem and PINS runs out of room on the first
# night of imaging.
#
# Runs on every boot until it SUCCEEDS. The "done" marker is written only after
# the filesystem is verified to cover its partition -- upstream's earlier version
# touched the marker unconditionally, so a host where growpart was missing
# recorded "done" on the first boot and never tried again, and shipped a root
# that never grew with nothing in the log to say so.
#
# Idempotent, and safe on a normal install where the partition already fills the
# disk: growpart reports there is nothing to do and the size check then writes
# the marker.
#
# Usage: pins-growroot.sh [device]
#   device  a partition to grow instead of "/". Only for testing the logic
#           against a loop device; the marker is not written in that mode.
