# Changes: renamed polaris->pins.
#
# Generate the SSH host keys when they are missing, before sshd is started.
#
# Why this exists: a shipped image must NOT carry host keys (every flashed device
# would share one identity, and anyone with the image could impersonate all of
# them), but something has to create them on the first boot of each device.
# Debian leaves that to the openssh-server postinst, which for an image runs on
# the build host and never again. The result is silent and total: ssh.service has
# ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sshd -t, which fails without a host key, so sshd dies at
# every boot and port 22 answers "connection refused" on a headless box.
#
# `ssh-keygen -A` creates only the key types that are missing, so this is
# idempotent by construction: on a host that already has its keys it is a no-op,
# and it never replaces an existing key.
